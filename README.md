# Project Title: Community Hunger and Food Security Project 


## Executive Summary

The dashboard reveals a **high level of food insecurity (37%)** across the community, driven mainly by **low income, informal employment, and large household sizes**. Households are adopting harmful coping strategies such as **reducing meal portions and sending children to relatives**, indicating that food insecurity is already affecting **nutrition, education, and long-term wellbeing**.

## Methodology: Food Insecurity Scoring Model

A household food insecurity scoring model was developed using four indicators:

1. **Meals per day** (>2 = 2points, 2 = 1point else 0)
2. **Whether the household ran out of food in the last 30 days** (No = 2points else 0)
3. **Meal skipping behavior** (No = 1point else 0)
4. **Use of coping strategies** (No all through = 1point else 0)

Each indicator was assigned points, with a **maximum possible score of six**.

* Households scoring **four or more points** were classified as **food secure**.
* Households scoring **three points** were classified as **moderately food insecure**.
* Households scoring **below three points** were classified as **severely food insecure (hungry)**.

The proportion of households in the severely food insecure category was calculated to determine the **overall hunger rate across the population**, which stands at **37%**.

## Key Insights

### 1. **Income is the strongest driver of hunger**

* **Low-income households:** 42% food insecure
* **Middle-income households:** 38%
* **High-income households:** 31%


  ➡️ Hunger decreases with income, but remains significant even at higher income levels, suggesting **systemic affordability issues**.

---

### 2. **Larger households are more vulnerable**

* **Households with 5+ members:** 41% food insecure
* **1–2 members:** 35%
* **3–5 members:** 33%


  ➡️ Bigger families face higher food stress due to **higher consumption needs and limited income growth**.

---

### 3. **Employment quality matters more than employment status**

* **Informal workers:** 46% food insecure (highest)
* **Unemployed:** 35%
* **Formal workers:** 26%


  ➡️ Informal employment is the **most vulnerable group**, likely due to unstable income and lack of social protection.

---

### 4. **Severe coping strategies are common**

* **Reduce meal portions:** 41.9%
* **Borrow food or money:** 38.6%
* **Send children to relatives:** 19.5%


  ➡️ These strategies signal **chronic food stress**, not short-term shocks.

---

### 5. **Social impact indicators are alarming**

* **Average meals per day:** 2
* **Income spent on food:** 55%
* **Children affected:** 286
* **Illness (malnutrition):** 61 cases
* **Kids missing school:** 31%


  ➡️ Food insecurity is directly linked to **education disruption and health risks**.

## Business / Policy Implications

* **Target groups:**

  * Informal workers
  * Low-income families
  * Large households
* **Risk areas:**

  * Child malnutrition
  * School absenteeism
  * Debt dependency (borrowing food/money)

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Short-Term (Relief Focus)

* Expand **food aid or meal subsidy programs** for:

  * Large households
  * Informal sector workers
* Introduce **school feeding programs** to reduce absenteeism.

### Medium-Term (Stability Focus)

* Support **income diversification** for informal workers.
* Implement **food price stabilization** or voucher systems.

### Long-Term (Structural Focus)

* Promote **formal employment pathways**.
* Invest in **nutrition education and maternal/child health** programs.

---

## Conclusion

Food insecurity in the community is **structural, not temporary**. The data shows a clear link between hunger and **income level, household size, and informal employment**, with visible consequences for **children’s education and health**. Without targeted intervention, these patterns will reinforce poverty cycles across generations.
